A structure is a collection of one or more variables, possibly of different types, grouped together under a single name for convenient handling.

Structures help to organize complicated data, because they permit a group of related variables to be treated as a unit instead of as seperate entities.

一个常见的例子：工资单。 name, address, ssn, salary, etc.

另一个例子： a point is a pair of coordinates, a rectangle is a pair of points.
